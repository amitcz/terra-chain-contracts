# COUNTER CONTRACT

- First need to compile down your smart contract into wasm.
- After uploading your wasm file, provides a contract code.
- The contract code is required to create new contract or instantiate the contract.
- Instantiating the contract will give a new smart contract address.
- We can perform invoke and query after that.
